      <h1>The Meaning <br>Behind<span style="color: #EB97BB;"><br>BLACKPINK</span></h1>
      <p>The group’s name was conceived to contrast with the perception of femininity commonly associated with pink.
        When Blackpink debuted, their label YG Entertainment said the name intends to convey that the group embodies
        more than beauty. “I may look sweet, but I don’t act like it,” Jennie sings in the opening lines of
        “Ddu-DuDdu-Du,” echoing this message.</p>
